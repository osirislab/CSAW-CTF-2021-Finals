# CSAW-CTF-2021-Finals

See individual challenges for `README.md` files. Many have walkthroughs, everything has a solver. Individual authors are cited for external collaborators, everything else was done in house. Not all industry challenges from the CTF are here, we only included those that we had permission to release. So we may add one or two more industry challenges after the repo officially becomes public. We hope you enjoy the challenges and happy hacking! Best wishes, the OSIRIS Lab
