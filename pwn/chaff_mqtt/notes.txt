       This is a "chaff" challenge. For this challenge, scattered around the binary are several dozen non-exploitable vulnerabilities and one exploitable one. This is meant as a way to harden a binary. In developing this challenge we wanted to avoid it being one where you get the flag if you are lucky. So, that is the reason for actually putting a lot of chaff in there as opposed to just a few non-exploitable vulnerabilites. In particular, you should be able to figure out a smarter way to get around the chaff without trying to exploit everything that looks like it might be vulnerable. In comparison, `baby_mqtt` has no chaff. Good luck!
