* General Test by Tester

# Intro
It's a challenge about VM escaping: a binary runs in the VM and people are supposed to use two vulnerabilities to escape from the VM.

## Vulnerabilities
* stack overflow in `CSAW-GAME` which is generated by orable.py
* Arbitraiy address free in `main.c` 

## Solution
* Use stack overflow to triggle the backdoor in `main.c` and free `tcache-persthred-struct`
* Back to `CSAW-GAME` and perform `Heap-Fengshui` to leak and finnaly write `__free_hook`.
