# Collision course

A database administrator wrote a script to create unique IDs from the original numeric IDs contained within a database. While doing so, they decided to use the original IDs to encrypt his password, since they were sure the original IDs couldn't be recovered. Prove them wrong and recover their password.

Tip - my_aes.py is a library they used for encrypting and decrypting password.bin. It can be used as a standalone script to decrypt the .bin file if the password is obtained

## Testing Result: Crypto - Collision course
No major issue found from the test. Only conflict is with the PyCryptodome library version needed in the my_aes.py file. 
My box has an existing pycryptodome==3.9.7 version and running the script with this version will result in a Argument TypeError in running line 53: data = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag) of the script. However if someone is to install it new which is pycryptodome==3.11.0, the script will run fine without error. Maybe on the comment on the top of my_aes.py file, make a note of that or specify the version of the PyCryptodome to install. 
Line 2: # Uses PyCryptodome (python3 -m pip install pycryptodome)  => # Uses PyCryptodome (python3 -m pip install pycryptodome==3.11.0)

b'flag{d0nt_g3t_2_s4lty}\n'

Q: How hard was the challenge to solve for you? As in how many people do you think will get it?
probably medium. given that the aes decryption function is provided in the my_aes file, the only part that needs to be figure out is the salt and the encrypted password. My guess is maybe 50% of the people will get it.  

Q: Could you think of other paths to the flag other than the intended one?
Na, not to my knowledge
