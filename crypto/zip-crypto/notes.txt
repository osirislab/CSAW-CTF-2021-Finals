solver to obtain the zip keys: 

bkcrack -C Tax_Ret_Form_Nov_2021.zip -c Tax_Ret_Form_Nov_2021.pdf -P Tax_Ret_Form_Blank.zip -p Tax_Ret_Form_Blank.pdf -t 12

(-t 12 is to make sure we are taking just 12 bytes, we can do it with much much more, even with all the blank form, hence it is possible to commit or extend the use of this flag)

use the keys to make a new zip archive with known password "cracked":

bkcrack -C Tax_Ret_Form_Nov_2021.zip -k 84e65f1e 39188afb 8a272de1 -U Tax_Ret_Form_Nov_2021_cracked.zip cracked

then you got the zip archive and you can extract it using the password "cracked" that we set above:

unzip -P cracked Tax_Ret_Form_Nov_2021_cracked.zip
