	The idea of the challenge is to take an advantage of a known vulnerability in the way windows used to encrypt zip files in the past. The broken algorithm is called ZIpCrypto ehich is today also known as "legacy windows encryption".The conditions for the attack to succeed is to know atleast 12 bytes of plaintext (atleast 8 of the bytes should be contiguous, also as long as the known plaintext is, the fastest the attack). The theme of the challenge is that a client insist to send his tax return form encrypted using that algoithm, to the CPA, even tho the CPA tells him that's not a safe algorithm anymore, and it's easily broken. This part of the challenge (break the ZIpCrypto algoritm) is done but there will be another "challenge" that covers this one. PCAP file should be provided contains all the email chain between the client to the CPA.
