Cryptohack (Robin_Jadoul and jack)

## Description

We only ever use the best technology for the job, so when something new comes out, we take the upgrade!

## Distribution to players

- run `make_dist.sh` and provide `dist.zip`
- network connection to the running challenge (web, so reverse proxy for tcp/hostname can be done)

## Deploying

See `Dockerfile`
